    <h2>Ethan Christenson</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone. My name is Ethan, I'm from Silverton Oregon and this will be my second semester here at BYUI. 
        I'm currently 20 and the second oldest of 8 siblings. Some of my hobbies include snowboarding, rock climbing and scuba diving.
        Craziest thing I've ever done: skydiving.
