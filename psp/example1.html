                    This is a dashboard that displays information about the selected item, its supply data, its forecast (high, low, expected),
                    and left over inventory based on selected demand. The user is able to select the item number and forecast type
                    in the top left, and all the numbers will change based on those, you'll see current inventory, what items are at risk of running out 
                    (and which are guaranteed to), the lead time on said item, etc. The bottom of the dashboard displays total availability and left over inventory
                    assuing that the maximum possible amounts of the item is ordered. The item yield is also taken into account.

                    This was the most complicated formula to make in this spreadsheet. It's an embedded IF statement that refers to the data on a different page of the spreadsheet.
                    There is a named range on this other page called "demand_data", within this named range there are 3 sub-ranges: expected forecast, low forecast, and high forecast.
                    The embedded if statement uses the selector for the expected forecast pick where to perform a VLOOKUP function that then uses the item number to return all the
                    forecast info about the selected item. All of the other forumlas in this example use simpler versions of this function to operate.
